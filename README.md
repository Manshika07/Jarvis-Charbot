# Jarvis-Charbot
The JARVIS Virtual Assistant project demonstrates the potential of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive voice-controlled chatbot. By leveraging the Web Speech API, JARVIS can listen to user commands, provide spoken responses, and execute actions like opening websites, answering queries, or displaying the time and date.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced virtual assistant systems, showcasing simplicity and effectiveness in its implementation. With further development, JARVIS could incorporate features like natural language processing, task automation, and integration with external APIs to become a more robust and intelligent assistant.

It highlights the power of web technologies in creating innovative, user-friendly applications.
